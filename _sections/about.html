<p>My name is Nick DeFilippis, a senior from Methacton High School.
  I love programming and working with computers.
  I hope one day to major in Computer Science.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I run for my high-school track and cross country team.
  I am a mid-distance runner (400 meters and 800 meters).
  You can find all my past results on my
  <a href = "http://pa.milesplit.com/athletes/insider/3676365-nicholas-defilippis/stats">
    milesplit page</a>
  </p>

  <p>When I'm not running, I'm coding. My main skills are:</p>
  <ul class ="skill-wrapper">
    <li class="skill">
      <div class="skill-number">1. </div>
      <h2>Java Development</h2>
      <p>I've been doing projects in Java for quite some time, and I've developed
        a knack for OOP. </p>
    </li>
    <li class="skill">
      <div class="skill-number">2. </div>
      <h2>Front-End Web Design</h2>
      <p>
        I've designed a few websites in my fair share of time, including this one.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="skill">
      <div class="skill-number">3. </div>
      <h2>Game Development</h2>
      <p>
        I've made a 2D mario platformer, as well as a 3D .obj file viewer. Pretty
        fun if you ask me.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I work on anything from websites to 3D renderers to physics engines. I can
    learn a new tech/language/etc. fairly quickly as well. The skills above are
    just what I'm best at currently.
    If you are intereseted in working with me or just to get in touch,
    you can contact me through <a href = "mailto:ndefilippis98@gmail.com">e-mail</a>
    or <a href="https://twitter.com/nick_defilippis">twitter</a>. I always love to hear from people.
